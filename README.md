## üöÄ Project Workflow

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigate the dataset to find initial patterns and insights.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data, handle categorical features, and scale numerical features.
3.  **Model Training:** Train and compare multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
4.  **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
5.  **(Future Work) Deployment:** Build a simple web application to serve the best-performing model.
